        <h3>Cracking The NFT Code</h3>

            For the past few weeks, NFTs are everywhere, it's been nearly impossible to go online without hearing something about them and most of you are probably scratching your heads wondering what it is. Is this all a hoax, or is this the future of the world?

            <h4>What on earth are NFTs, though?</h4>

            To better understand what NFTs are, you need to know what non-fungible means. Consider a 500-rupee note; millions of such are likely in circulation right now. Keep in mind that all of it is original, but its exchangeability makes them fungible. Monalisa, on the other hand, well, you can't exchange it for another Monalisa; it's one-of-a-kind, and that's what non-fungible means. Digital art, however, is fungible because it can be copied or downloaded infinitely, which is where NFT comes into play.
When someone buys a piece of art, it typically comes with the artist's signature or a certificate proving its authenticity. Owning an NFTed version of it does the same thing, but digitally.

It turns out that our cute Nyan cat's GIF got sold as an NFT, which is where it got its actual value. I know it's insane, but stick with me; everything will make sense once I break it down for you.
